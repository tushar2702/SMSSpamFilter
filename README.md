SMSSpamFilter
==============

SMS Spam Filter is a Java application to classify SMS into spam or non-spam using Naive Bayesian Classification and Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithms. Implemented N-grams with SVM using Weka Libraries to improve accuracy of the model. A detailed comparison and evaluation of both the machine learning techniques is done in the final project paper. Also created a basic Android User Interface for this project.
